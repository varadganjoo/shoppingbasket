# Shopping Basket ReactJs

This is a shopping basket web app that allows users to select products from a product list. It then stores the desired products in a "cart". Once the user has finished, they can access the cart in order to calculate the monthly cost as well as the ongoing costs.

Dataset created using the publically accessible information from the Telstra Website.

The site can be accessed at: https://shopping-basket-83e33.web.app/ (https://shopping-basket-83e33.web.app/)
